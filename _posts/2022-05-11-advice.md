[Quora Session with Scott Aaronson](https://quorasessionwithscottaaronson.quora.com/)에서 인상 깊은 질문 및 답변을 번역 없이 옮긴다.

## What's your advice to someone beginning his/her PhD in Theoretical Computer Science?

Take charge. Don’t wait for your adviser or anyone else to hand you a problem to work on. They might, but in the meantime, invent your own problems, and pick them up from papers and blogs and friends and lectures, driven by your thirst to know and prove. Don’t obey your adviser; astound your adviser. Go to conference after conference, STOC after Dagstuhl after Banff, like a hungry coyote on the prowl—-hungry for open problems to solve and for collaborators who know how to solve your problems. Get used to the sun rising in the window as you struggle with LaTeX packages or hunt for a new notebook after you filled your old one, smearing blue ink on your palms. At some point, go out, treat yourself to a large breakfast, then get a good day’s sleep, since there’s probably another long night ahead. (Did you remember to check when the conference submission deadline was?)

Understand: for the entire rest of your life, people will be badgering you with emails. You’ll spend more than half of every day answering those emails, and still they’ll never stop. From morning to night—-and that’s what it will be, since you’ll no longer get to pull all-nighters, ever—-you’ll be dealing with your mortgage, grocery shopping, your kid’s daycare, students unhappy about their exam grade, program committee chairs yelling that your referee report is overdue, grant officers yelling that your quarterly progress report is overdue, book editors yelling that your chapter is overdue, travel reimbursements, journalists who need you to repeat the same tired quote for a pop-science article, etc. You’ll typically have zero hours per day—-as in none, zero—-to devote to research. Nobody will be in charge, making sure you still have those hours—-*you* certainly won’t—-so why would they remain in your day? And even when you do have free time, you’ll be so stressed and tired that you just want to nap on the sofa or browse social media, not think about research, which requires endless weeks of no other responsibilities to get into the groove of.

This is *assuming* that you don’t also have a blog or other public presence. :-)

What does this all mean? It means that grad school, together with your postdoc, are your time to leap for the moon. It’s not preparation for anything else; it’s *the* thing that you’ve been preparing for. This is when there’s a very good chance that you’ll think many of your most original thoughts and do much of your most important work. So, if you wanted there to be one time in your life when you’d let nothing get between you and the Eternal, when you wanted your theorem-proving efforts to follow the Kipling model—-

>> If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
>>
>> To serve your turn long after they are gone,
>>
>> And so hold on when there is nothing in you
>>
>> Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ …

—-let this be the time.

Also, remember to have fun!
